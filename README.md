# Deep Learning Architectures

<p><t>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is mainly done to explore various deep neural network architectures used in classifying images. Also, a choice of various other parameters used during modeling the networks such as regularization parameters, weight decay methods, choice of activation functions, and optimizer selection, are explored. Some of the other additions which are implemented in this project are Tensorboard, early stopping and layer weights initialization. The architectures that are implemented in this project are VGG16, ResNet18 and Inception v2 for which the accuracy, precision and recall are calculated for various settings (like change in optimizer and regularization methods). In section 2, the details regarding the hypermeter selection for all the settings are mentioned. In Section 3, an overview of these implemented architectures is discussed. In Section 4, different plots related to the network training and validation sets are presented and explained. Finally, in Section 5 the table with the values of accuracy, recall and precision for different settings are presented.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of this project, we wish to compare how different parameters effect the model training and validation accuracy. Also, this project helped me in gaining hands-on experience over modelling different architectures and implementing them in code. The comparison is useful as it lets us have practical experience while choosing different methods and see real-time changes in accuracy and training. This will allow us have to have a informed decision making in future projects when we are trying to implement a new network.
<p>TLDR: A project to explore different deep learning architectures and compare their learning and validation accuracy by varying discrete parameter settings like optimiser choice (SGD or ADAM) and regularisation methods (no regularisation, batch normalisation or dropout).</p>
